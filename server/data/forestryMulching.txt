## This guy’s making \$70K/month clearing brush with a \$130K machine he barely knew how to drive.

No landscaping background. No forestry experience.
Just YouTube videos, a skid steer… and a giant pain in the a\*\* backyard.

Now he's running a 6-figure operation outside Cincinnati.
Here’s how he built it from scratch.

---

It started with 5 acres of overgrown land.

Alex just wanted to clear his property.

But when he went looking for help?
Crickets.

Nobody offered forestry mulching nearby.
The few who did were booked solid or wildly overpriced.

So he rented a machine and did it himself.
Then had a thought:

> “What if I do this for other people?”

---

Zero experience. But he had two things:

1. A marketing brain
2. A camera

He started filming jobs. Posted them to YouTube.
Added a phone number. Ran a few Meta ads.

The leads came rolling in.

---

The model?

> Clear land. Film it. Book more jobs.

Simple.

He borrowed to buy a skid steer with a mulching head.
All-in? \$90K–\$130K depending on the setup.

But with 0% interest and a low down payment, the math worked.

One job = \$3,100.
One job = covers the monthly payment.

Everything else? Margin.

---

He leaned hard into content.

**Before/after videos.**
**Educational explainers.**
**No hard sells. Just value.**

People searched stuff like:

> “How to clear my woods”
> “Get rid of honeysuckle”
> “Brush mulching Cincinnati”

And guess who showed up?

Alex.

---

His secret weapon?

**Local targeting.**

He ran Meta (FB/IG) ads to zip codes where people had land.
Ages 35+. Into rural living, trucks, Tractor Supply-type stuff.

No broad radius. No spray-and-pray.

Just laser-focused on the right 5–10 miles.

---

Now the numbers:

* Started: \$17K in Month 1
* Now: \$70K/month in revenue
* Jobs: \~\$3,100 average
* Margins: \~70%
* Leads: \~80% come from YouTube + Meta ads

This isn’t just mowing lawns.
It’s **premium land clearing** for people who don’t want to mess with brush, vines, and stumps.

---

The equipment?

Not cheap.

* Skid steer with forestry package
* Mulching head: up to \$38K
* Daily rental? \$2,700 (so buying makes more sense)

He buys **new**, not used.
Why?

Warranties. Reliability. No downtime.

Even budgets in 15% for repairs.

---

Barriers = opportunity.

Most people won’t drop six figures on gear they’ve never run.
Most don’t want to spend weekends clearing thorns.

That’s the moat.

Alex leaned into that.

---

Next level?

He’s eyeing **remote-controlled machines** like Green Climber.
Perfect for steep hills and commercial jobs.

Less risk. Less fatigue. Higher prices.

It’s where the industry is going.

---

What about growth?

Right now, he’s limited by logistics.

His truck hauls two machines max.
Wants to upgrade and scale to 4–5 crews.

Still low overhead. Still lean ops.

---

Even partnerships?

Tried working with tree services. Some referrals came in, but nothing beats his own leads.

He’s sticking to brush clearing.

It’s his niche. His brand.

---

Alex’s take?

He *wants* more people in the space.

Not competition. Collaboration.

> “The more people know about this, the more the pie grows.”

It’s true. Most property owners don’t even know this service exists.

---

Want to copy the playbook?

Here’s how:

1. Rent a machine. Clear a few lots.
2. Film everything. Post to YouTube.
3. Run local Meta ads with real footage.
4. Use the first few jobs to finance your own equipment.
5. Repeat.

No agency. No cold calls. No fancy CRM.

Just video + trust + targeted ads.

---

This isn’t landscaping. This isn’t flipping homes.

It’s a **niche blue-collar business** with fat margins.

You’re selling:

🌲 Cleared land
📹 Proof of work
📍 Local trust
💸 Daily-rate jobs with real ROI

---

Alex didn’t invent forestry mulching.

He just packaged it better.

With video. With strategy. With marketing most operators ignore.

That’s why it’s working.

---

**The model:**

> **Educate → Market → Clear → Scale**

No tech. No gimmicks.
Just a machine, a GoPro, and a service people desperately need.
