## 5. She cleans Airbnb hot tubs for \$75/week—and does 40 of them.

Hosts hate cleaning spas. But guests love hot tubs.

That tension? Goldmine.

She offered **weekly hot tub maintenance** for Airbnb properties.

\$50–\$75 per visit. Recurring.

Started with 3 units. Scaled to 40+. Built a system with:

* Zapier
* Google Sheets
* Slack + SMS updates

Now it’s a lean team. Fast response. Great margins.

Hosts *need* this to keep reviews up.
Guests expect spotless water.

She made herself essential.

**The model:**

> Airbnb booked → Spa gets dirty → You fix it weekly

Subscription revenue. Zero ad spend.
And hosts never churn.
