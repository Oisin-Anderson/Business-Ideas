Bought a **spa dolly**. Watched a few YouTube tutorials.
Started offering **hot tub moving services**.

First job: \$600.
Now? Books 3–5 per week at \$500–\$900 each.

Specialized. Insured. Reliable.

He shows up on time, straps it tight, and hauls with care.
5-star reviews follow.

No one competes—because no one wants the work.

**The model:**

> Spa for sale → Buyer needs delivery → You roll in

Low startup. High margin.
And no one else wants to touch it.
