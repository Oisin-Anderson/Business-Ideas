## This 23-year-old is making $10K/month renting washers and dryers he doesn't even own.

No investors. No employees. No truck.

He started with $0. Literally.

Here's how you can copy his exact playbook.

---

It started with Facebook Marketplace.

He was just screwing around, posting random rental listings for stuff he didn't ownâ€”paddleboards, luxury bathrooms, dump trailers. He'd pull a photo off Google, throw it up with a rental price, and wait.

If someone bit, he'd go get the item.
If not, he'd delete the post. No risk.

Then one day, he posted a washer and dryer for $50/month.

Just a basic set. Stock photo. $0 invested.

He left for a cruise and came back to **30+ messages** from people begging to rent them.

He had no machines. No plan. But he knew he was onto something.

---

He called it **Post â†’ Rent â†’ Buy.**

And it's exactly what it sounds like.

1. **Post** a washer/dryer for rent on Facebook.
2. **Rent** it to someone who messages.
3. **Buy** the machine *after* it's already booked.

His first customer needed it the next day. So he bought a set from RC Willey for $1,000.

By the end of that week, he bought two more.

He didn't even have a contract yet. Just a handshake and CashApp.

The risk? Basically zero.

If it didn't work, he could sell the machines and get his money back.

---

The installs were rough at first.

His first customer thought the dryer was broken. Turned out the vent was clogged with lint.

Total learning curve.

He didn't quit. Just kept going.

That first payment hit a month later: **$60 recurring.**

And something clicked.

He realized this wasn't just a rental.

It was **cash flow on autopilot**.

---

In the first month, he installed 17 sets.
The second month, 13 more.

He found a local vendor and bought used machines in bulk. Told them he was a property manager.

They gave him a deal.

He spent $30K in December on appliances.

By February, he was clearing **$2,400/month** in recurring revenue.

Not flipping.
Not selling.

**Rentals.**

Every set went out for $50â€“$60/month.

---

Then came the breakthrough:

People don't care if the machines are new.

He thought they'd want shiny, unboxed sets. So he bought new.

Then he tested used onesâ€”old, beat-up, but working.

Demand stayed the same.

All people wanted was **clean clothes without hassle.**

The cheaper his cost, the faster he scaled.

---

Then he got smart about sourcing.

Here's how he finds machines for **$0â€“$200**:

1. **Facebook Marketplace** â€“ Search for "free" or "broken" units. Tons of people just want them gone.
2. **Used appliance shops** â€“ Offer to haul away old sets they don't want.
3. **Big box delivery drivers** â€“ When people buy new, the old ones get left behind. He gave drivers his number. Now they text him when they've got inventory.

He gets sets for free. Fixes them using spare parts.

Most repairs? Under $30.

---

Still doesn't own a truck.

He hauls everything in a **Toyota Highlander** with a **$500 trailer**.

Can fit 6 machines at a time.

Even without a car, you can rent from **Home Depot for $25/day**.

Or just install a hitch on your daily driver.

That's the move.

---

The tools?

Literally just:

* A power drill
* A pair of channel locks

That's it.

Installs take 30â€“45 minutes. Pickups, same.

No team. No tech. Just sweat.

---

He loves old **Whirlpool direct drive** units.

Discontinued in 2013.

They're tanks. Built like Speed Queen. But way cheaper.

Easy to fix. Run forever. Parts are everywhere.

He grabs them for $100â€“$200 and rents them for $60/month.

**Pays themselves off in 2â€“3 months.**

Then it's pure margin.

---

Marketing?

All Facebook Marketplace.

He runs **5â€“7 accounts**, each with a different zip code.

Rotates photos, tweaks the copy, lists at $50/month to stand out.

Replies fast. That's the key.

Facebook wants you to respond ASAP. The faster you answer, the more they show your post.

It's not about fancy ads. It's about volume and velocity.

---

Next move: **door hangers.**

He printed 10,000 of them for $500.

Targets apartment complexes that don't include washers/dryers.

Hits 200 doors in 30 minutes. Gets 3â€“4 leads every run.

It's old school. But it works.

Goal: get to $20K/month without spending real ad money.

---

Operations are stupid simple:

* Deliver the set
* Plug it in
* Show the customer how it works
* Get their card
* Set up Stripe for monthly billing

No leases. Month-to-month.

If it breaks, he fixes it. If they move, he picks it up and rerents it.

His churn? **1.5% a month.**

Machines are back out within days.

---

Service calls?

Maybe 1â€“2 a week.

And most are solved over the phone.

People just forget to turn the water on.

He coaches them through it. No big deal.

Machines are workhorses.

---

He's at **120+ units** now.

And he's still doing the installs himself.

No employees. No office. No backend system.

Just a trailer, a drill, and Stripe.

But he's got **$10K/month in recurring revenue**.

Most people don't even realize this niche exists.

Which is exactly why it works.

---

Want to start today?

Start by delivering machines for used appliance stores.

Most don't offer delivery.

Tell them you'll do installs for $100/set. Pick up the units people are replacing.

Start building your inventory for free.

---

There's a guy with **900 sets** doing this exact model.

Works 2â€“3 days a week. That's it.

The blueprint is wide open.

Most people are too focused on crypto, dropshipping, or building apps.

Meanwhile, Kyler is printing cash doing the unsexy stuff.

---

**The full model:**

> **Post â†’ Rent â†’ Buy**

That's it.

* Post a listing on Facebook Marketplace.
* When someone wants it, close the deal.
* Then go buy the machine and deliver.

No capital. No debt. No guesswork.

Just **proof of demand before you spend a dollar**.

---

This isn't dropshipping. This isn't real estate.

It's a blue-collar cash cow with 70%+ margins.

You're solving a real problem with a simple offer:

ðŸ’§ Clean clothes
ðŸ“¦ No delivery fees
ðŸ”„ Month-to-month
ðŸ›  Free maintenance

Low risk. High yield. Recession-proof.

Kyler didn't go viral. He didn't raise money.

He just found a market no one else was looking atâ€¦

And filled it with something people already wanted.

Washer and dryer rentals.

No truck. No cash. No excuses.
